## 🚩 Updates/Todo List

- [x] Memory optimization in [optimized_branch](https://github.com/Young98CN/LoRA_Composer/tree/optimized_version)  (There is a lot of GPU memory redundancy in the existing code, and N concept LoRAs need to store N pipelines).
- [x] Code Released.



## :wrench: Dependencies and Installation

- Python >= 3.9 (Recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
- Diffusers==0.14.0
- [PyTorch >= 1.12](https://pytorch.org/)
- NVIDIA GPU (60G memory) + [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

### Installation

1. Install torch

```bash
conda create -n loracomposer python=3.10 -y
conda activate loracomposer
# install PyTorch
conda install pytorch==1.12.0 torchvision==0.13.0 torchaudio==0.12.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -y
```


2. Clone repo & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Young98CN/LoRA_Composer.git
cd LoRA_Composer
pip install .

# Install diffusers==0.14.0 with T2I-Adapter support(install from source)
git clone -b T2IAdapter-for-mixofshow https://github.com/guyuchao/diffusers-t2i-adapter.git
cd diffusers-t2i-adapter
pip install .
```



## ⏬ Pretrained Model and Data Preparation

### Pretrained Model Preparation

We adopt the [ChilloutMix](https://huggingface.co/windwhinny/chilloutmix) for real-world concepts, and [Anything-v4](https://huggingface.co/xyn-ai/anything-v4.0) for anime concepts.

```bash
cd experiments/pretrained_models
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed
git lfs install

# Diffusers-version ChilloutMix
git-lfs clone https://huggingface.co/windwhinny/chilloutmix.git

# Diffusers-version Anything-v4
git-lfs clone https://huggingface.co/andite/anything-v4.0.git --exclude="anything*, Anything*, example*"

mkdir t2i_adapter
cd t2i_adapter

# sketch/openpose adapter of T2I-Adapter
wget https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter/resolve/main/models/t2iadapter_sketch_sd14v1.pth
wget https://huggingface.co/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter/resolve/main/models/t2iadapter_openpose_sd14v1.pth
```

## :runner: Some instances in the paper
1. Merge the LoRA with the base model
```bash
# in the path of root folder
find scripts/lora_composer_scripts/merge_EDLoRA -type f -name "*.sh" -exec echo "Executing {}" \; -exec bash {} \;

python scripts/lora_composer_scripts/merge_EDLoRA/link_lora2folder.py
```
2. Partial results of the paper can be obtained by running the following command
```bash
bash scripts/lora_composer_scripts/paper_result_scripts/lora_composer_anime.sh
bash scripts/lora_composer_scripts/paper_result_scripts/lora_composer_real.sh
```


## :computer: ED-LoRA Training (For user customized images)
1. Follow by offical implement of [ED-LoRA](https://github.com/TencentARC/Mix-of-Show/tree/research_branch#:~:text=Single%2DClient%20Concept%20Tuning), or follow the [newer release version](https://github.com/TencentARC/Mix-of-Show/tree/main#:~:text=Single%2DClient%20Concept%20Tuning)(**Recommend**). (It is better for performence).
2. Then merge the LoRA with the pre-trained model (For example Haibara_Ai).
```bash
# The newer release version should convert to the LoRA checkpoint fist
python scripts/lora_composer_scripts/convert_old_EDLoRA.py ${ckpt_path} ${save_path}

# Then merge the weight (For older versions, just use this command)
bash scripts/lora_composer_scripts/merge_EDLoRA/anime/merge_ai.sh
```
